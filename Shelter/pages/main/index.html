      <p class="info__subtitle">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands
        and statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family. The others will
        continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance to become
        dearly loved.
      </p>
      <p class="info__subtitle">We feed our wards with the best food and make sure
        that they do not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and
        well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various skill
        levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care
        of the animals, they become attached to&nbspthe pets and would hardly ever leave
        them alone.
